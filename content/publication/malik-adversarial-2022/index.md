abstract: 'Transferable adversarial attacks optimize adversaries from a pretrained
  surrogate model and known label space to fool the unknown black-box models. Therefore,
  these attacks are restricted by the availability of an effective surrogate model.
  In this work, we relax this assumption and propose Adversarial Pixel Restoration
  as a self-supervised alternative to train an effective surrogate model from scratch
  under the condition of no labels and few data samples. Our training approach is
  based on a min-max scheme which reduces overfitting via an adversarial objective
  and thus optimizes for a more generalizable surrogate model. Our proposed attack
  is complimentary to the adversarial pixel restoration and is independent of any
  task specific objective as it can be launched in a self-supervised manner. We successfully
  demonstrate the adversarial transferability of our approach to Vision Transformers
  as well as Convolutional Neural Networks for the tasks of classification, object
  detection, and video segmentation. Our training approach improves the transferability
  of the baseline unsupervised training method by 16.4% on ImageNet val. set. Our
  codes & pre-trained surrogate models are available at: https://github.com/HashmatShadab/APR'
