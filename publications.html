                 In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of VSSMs' robustness under various perturbation scenarios, including occlusions,
                image structure, common corruptions, and adversarial attacks, and compare their performance to well-established architectures such as transformers
                and Convolutional Neural Networks. Furthermore, we investigate the resilience of VSSMs to object-background compositional changes on sophisticated
                benchmarks designed to test model performance in complex visual scenes. We also assess their robustness on object detection and segmentation tasks
                using corrupted datasets that mimic real-world scenarios. To gain a deeper understanding of VSSMs' adversarial robustness, we conduct a frequency-based
                analysis of adversarial attacks, evaluating their performance against low-frequency and high-frequency perturbations. Our findings highlight the
                strengths and limitations of VSSMs in handling complex visual corruptions, offering valuable insights for future research.

                We propose ObjectCompose, which can induce diverse object-to-background changes while preserving the original semantics and appearance of the object.
                To achieve this goal, we harness the generative capabilities of text-to-image, image-to-text, and image-to-segment models to automatically generate a
                broad spectrum of object-to-background changes. We induce both natural and adversarial background changes by either modifying the textual prompts or
                optimizing the latents and textual embedding of text-to-image models. We produce various versions of standard vision datasets (ImageNet, COCO),
                incorporating either diverse and realistic backgrounds into the images or introducing color, texture, and adversarial changes in the background.
                We conduct extensive experiments to analyze the robustness of vision-based models against object-to-background context variations across diverse tasks.

            <h3>Evaluating Robustness of Volumetric Medical Segmentation Models [BMVC 2024]</h3>

                Our work aims to empirically examine the adversarial robustness across current volumetric medical segmentation architectures, encompassing
                Convolutional, Transformer, and Mamba-based models. We extend this investigation across four volumetric segmentation datasets,
                evaluating robustness under both white box and black box adversarial attacks. Overall, we observe that while both pixel and frequency-based
                attacks perform reasonably well under white box setting, the latter performs significantly better under transfer-based black box attacks.
                Across our experiments, we observe transformer-based models show higher robustness than convolution-based models with Mamba-based models
                being the most vulnerable. Additionally, we show that large-scale training of volumetric segmentation models improves the model's robustness
                against adversarial attacks.

            <h3>Adversarial Pixel Restoration as a Pretext Task for Transferable Perturbations [BMVC 2022 Oral]</h3>

                Transferable adversarial attacks optimize adversaries from a pretrained surrogate model and known label space to fool the unknown
                black-box models. Therefore, these attacks are restricted by the availability of an effective surrogate model. In this work,
                we relax this assumption and propose Adversarial Pixel Restoration as a self-supervised alternative to train an effective surrogate model
                from scratch under the condition of no labels and few data samples. Our training approach is based on a min-max scheme which reduces
                overfitting via an adversarial objective and thus optimizes for a more generalizable surrogate model. Our proposed attack is complimentary
                to the adversarial pixel restoration and is independent of any task specific objective as it can be launched in a self-supervised manner.
                We successfully demonstrate the adversarial transferability of our approach to Vision Transformers as well as Convolutional Neural Networks
                for the tasks of classification, object detection, and video segmentation. Our training approach improves the transferability of the baseline
                unsupervised training method by 16.4% on ImageNet val. set.
